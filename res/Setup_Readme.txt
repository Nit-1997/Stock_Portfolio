Stock-App : Set-up Readme
================================================

------------------------------------------------
Folder Structure Required to run the JAR
------------------------------------------------

    assignment.zip :  unzip it.

    assignment
         |_ assignment.jar
         |_ stock
              |_ stock_list.csv ( contains list of stock symbols supported by the application)

    After the jar is running , the Program creates 2 more directories in Runtime :-

    - portfolios :- This stores all the newly created portfolios / if using manual files ,
                    create this repo manually then add those csv files in it.
           |_ flex :-  portfolios directory consists of flex directory that keeps track of the flexible portfolios, if you wish to create one manually create the csv here.
    - stock_data :- This stores the historic API data dump for the stock to be added dynamically into a csv file


===============================================
How To Run Program
===============================================

1.) Unzip the submission file
2.) You should see the stock folder with stock_list.csv file containing all the stockâ€™s ticker symbol we support.
3.) In cmd/terminal enter java -jar assignment.jar
4.) make sure you maintain the folder structure as mentioned above.

===============================================
How to Run Tests
===============================================
For the tests to work properly your folder structure should look like this :-
         |_ src
         |_ test
         |_ testingArtifacts (contains dumps required to run tests)
         |_ portfolios/flex/flexUserTest2.csv (contains seed portfolois required for the tests to run correctly , NOTE: application works even without this only tests will fail as they need this to validate certain scenarios)
1.) In order to run the tests we require testingArtifacts and portfolios/flex/flexUserTest2.csv folder at the root level to dump all the testing data.
2.) You can go to the test and then run all tests and that should trigger the Junit for all the tests.
